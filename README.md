# COBrA kai

## Overview

This project concerns the implementation of a blockchain-based fair content trade system 
over the Ethereum network - dubbed *COBrA* (fair **CO**ntent trade on the **B**lockch**A**in) -
and the relative front-end webapp that customers and creators of the system can use, dubbed
*COBrA kai* (COBrA **k**ai **a**pplication **i**nterface).

COBrA kai was developed as the final project for the course of *Peer to Peer Systems and
Blockchains* (P2PBC) taught by Prof. [Laura Emilia Ricci](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ricci/) at
University of Pisa for the *Master's Degree in Computer Science* and *Master's Degree in
Computer Science and Networking*. It is both a refinement and an extension to the endterm 
project for the same course, which asked students to implement the *COBrA* portion of the
system. Both assignment papers - the endterm and the final project ones - are provided under
the `Assignment` directory.
